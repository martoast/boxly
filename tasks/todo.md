# Update Terms of Service & Privacy Policy — Liability Disclaimers

## Goal
Make it very clear that Boxly is an **importation logistics provider**, NOT a shipping company. Boxly is not liable for any damages, losses, or theft once packages are handed off to carriers (Estafeta/DHL) — in both USA and Mexico. If a product arrives damaged or has any issues, it is the user's responsibility to handle it directly with the store/retailer, not Boxly.
